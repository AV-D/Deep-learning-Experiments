# Deep-learning-Experiments

# 1. I built a basic PyTorch and TensorFlow Model Implementation:
Assignment involves implementing a machine learning model using both PyTorch and TensorFlow. The goal is to gain hands-on experience with these two popular deep learning frameworks, understand their similarities and differences, and learn how to manipulate data and build models in each.
**Dataset**
The dataset used in this homework is a preprocessed version of the Pima Indians Diabetes Database. It consists of 758 instances, each with 8 features (`f1` to `f8`) and a binary class label (`label`). The features represent various diagnostic measures and the label indicates the presence (1) or absence (0) of diabetes.

## Tasks
1. **Data Loading**: Import the data from the provided `diabetes.csv` file. The first eight columns are the features and the last column is the label.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: Perform any necessary preprocessing on the dataset such as normalization, handling missing values, etc.

3. **Model Building**: Implement a machine learning model using both PyTorch and TensorFlow. The model should be able to predict the binary class label based on the input features.

4. **Training**: Train the models on the dataset, ensuring proper validation and evaluation techniques are used to prevent overfitting.

5. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of the models using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

6. **Comparison**: Compare the results obtained from both frameworks and discuss any observed differences in performance, ease of use, or any other notable points.
